Code is Documentation
---------------------

Rather than attempt to describe the rules of the blockchain, it is up to
each individual to inspect the code to understand the consensus rules.  

Build Instructions
------------------
These instructions apply on Fedora 24. For other distributions, make sure you have 
installed Boost 1.58-1.60 first.
For building, you need at least 4 GB of memory available.

    sudo dnf clean metadata
    sudo dnf install automake autoconf libtool make cmake gcc flex bison doxygen gettext-devel git readline-devel openssl-devel libcurl-devel ncurses-devel boost-devel boost-static gcc-c++
    mkdir -p ~/dev/MUSE
    cd ~/dev/MUSE
    git clone https://github.com/themuseblockchain/Muse-Source.git
    cd ~/dev/MUSE/Muse-Source
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    mkdir -p ~/dev/MUSE/MUSE-build
    cd ../MUSE-build
    #optionally specify Boost root directory in case it is not installed on standard paths with -DBOOST_ROOT=/location/
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ~/dev/MUSE/Muse-Source/ 
    #optionally, install the binaries
    cmake --build . --target all -- -j 3
    
Now the binaries shall be in directory ~/dev/MUSE/MUSE-build/programs/

How to Start
------------
First, start MUSE daemon:

    cd ~/dev/MUSE/MUSE-build
    ./programs/mused/mused -s 138.197.68.175:29092 --rpc-endpoint=127.0.0.1:8090
    
The daemon is ready. The JSON-RPC is listening on localhost on port 8090
